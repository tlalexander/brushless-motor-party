## Let's Have Brushless Motor Party

Brushless motors are one type of electric motor that work great for robotics! They are very powerful and can be precisely controlled from software.
This page is intended to explain to a beginner how and where to get started using these motors in projects.

### Prologue: Brushed Motors and Steppers

Whoa there! Before you go and spend $200 on a brushless motor and controller combination, let's make sure all that expense is worth it.

A brushed motor is simpler than a brushless motor. The motor itself is cheaper, and they are also easier to control which makes their motor controllers cheaper. They have less power output than a brushless motor. Many projects will work well with brushed motors, and the expense of brushless motors is not necessary. Look up "12v DC motor" or "12v DC gearmotor" on your preferred web store and see what comes up. (They often run on 12 volts, but this is just a jumping off point. 6v and 24v are also common) Amazon and Aliexpress are two places to look. You will need an "H-Bridge" controller to control the motor in both directions with software. If you only need the motor to move in one direction, you only need a power source and a switch, either a mechanical switch or a MOSFET hooked up to a controller. This might be Arduino or Raspbery Pi. To control speed or position of the motor, see Encoders this page. To control motor torque, find a way to control the current, possibly with a current sensor and PWM on the motor.

Stepper Motors are another option. They can easily be controlled with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, they are cheap and they have cheap drivers. But they are low on maximum torque and maximum speed. They are also not very energy efficient as they draw power even when stopped unless you disable the driver, so they may not be a good choice for battery operated vehicles. If you need precise control and do not need high torque, they may be a good option.

### Hardware Basics: Brushless Motors

Brushless motors are great when you want a high performance motor option for your robot. You will have to invest in an expensive motor controller, a good motor and a high power battery or power converter. Not cheap! But you will end up with a fast and powerful motor you can control from software.

The original and main motivation for this page is to catalog the current best brushless motor controllers for robotics.

These are: VESC, ODrive, and Moteus
